# Py-Pico-Midi-Expression-Pedal

This is a Raspberry Pi Pico MicroPython project that takes an expression pedal input via a TRS 1/4" jack connected to ADC pins on the Pico, and outputs a Midi CC message equivalent via USB.

Midi channel, CC number, and maximum and minimum values can all be set as required.
